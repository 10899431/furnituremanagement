FurniMaker - Interactive Furniture Design Desktop Application
ðŸ“Œ Overview

FurniMaker is a desktop application designed to assist contemporary furniture designers in-store by providing an interactive platform to visualize furniture layouts in both 2D and 3D. This tool allows designers to input room dimensions, shapes, and color schemes, then place, scale, shade, and arrange furniture items to preview personalized room designs with real-time 3D visualization.

The application aims to enhance customer engagement and decision-making by offering a user-friendly, visually rich interface that bridges the gap between static catalogs and real-world spatial design.

With FurniMaker, designers can:

Create editable 2D floor plans with snap-to-grid alignment.

Switch seamlessly to real-time 3D room visualizations.

Customize furniture colors, shading, and scale for accurate presentations.

Save and reload room layouts in a standard format for future editing.
